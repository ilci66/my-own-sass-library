# Personal Sass Library

## Project Description
A sass library created from scratch for future use

### Motivation
My main motivation was to understand the workings of sass and get comfortable using it in the larger projects I'm planning on developing in the future 

### Technologies Used:
*   **HTML, CSS** 
*   **Sass**

### Challanges and Improvements
*   Many additions can be done in the future about literally everything, I'm planning on improving it as I go and create a library I can use for a design method called "Atomic Design"
